# NLP

### - now the main goal here is to learn how to fine-tune Word2Vec model for the financial dataset.
      -  build a embedding model that give better or near same results to FinBert model.

### - these embedding models are used for sentiment analysis , summarization etc
      - so we are creating a embedding model that can be used for sentiment analysis for financial text.

- we will first label the dataset for sentiment analysis using FinBert model and consider it as benchmark .
- we will fine-tune Word2Vec model to our dataset , to create a new embedding model.
- use our embedding model and build a sentiment analyzer that will give near results to the FinBert.
