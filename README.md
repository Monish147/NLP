### - now the main goal here is to learn how to fine-tune Word2Vec model for the financial dataset.
      -  build a embedding model that give better or near same results to FinBert model.

### - these embedding models are used for sentiment analysis , summarization etc
      - so we are creating a embedding model that can be used for sentiment analysis for financial text.

- we will first label the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notlucasp/financial-news-headlines/data) for sentiment analysis using FinBert model and consider it as benchmark.[reference](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C6_ahu0Eps_wLKcsfspEO0HIEouND-oI?usp=sharing)
- we will [fine-tune Word2Vec model](https://czarrar.github.io/Gensim-Word2Vec/) to our dataset , to create a new embedding model.
- use our embedding model and build a sentiment analyzer that will give near results to the FinBert.[reference](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohanamitarathod/pr-financial-news-sentiment-analysis-using-nltk#What-is-sentiment-analysis-?)
